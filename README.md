This website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), utilizing the [Ananke Gohugo Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/)

## Adding yourself to the website
To add an entry for yourself, submit a PR with a markdown file.

You can see examples of this in the following sub-directory of this repo

*content/employees*

There is also a provided bash script for easily generating a new markdown page. Simply run `./generate_employee.sh`, provide the requested input values, and the script will generate the page for you.

Github flavored markdown is supported among many other things. For more information on the type of markdown see the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/)
